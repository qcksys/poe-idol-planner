add trade search improvements:
- default to instant buyout (status: available) instead of "any"
- map unique idol mods to trade stat IDs in data script
- unique idol "Maps found in Area" uses implicit stat ID (base implicit, 2% per cell)
- regular prefix mod uses explicit stat ID as expected
- enable trade searching for unique idol mods
- show base implicit "X% increased Maps found in Area" in stats summary (2% per cell)
