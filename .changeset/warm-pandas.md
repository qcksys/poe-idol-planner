- Mods above the weight threshold are added to a "not" filter in trade API (excludes items with common mods)
- Add toggle switch to enable/disable weight filtering
- Add single-mod trade search buttons in mods search modal and idol tooltips
- Fix league name validation to allow periods (e.g., "Phrecia 2.0")
