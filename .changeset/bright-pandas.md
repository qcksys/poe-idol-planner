Improve idol mechanic detection by extracting mechanics from mod family IDs before falling back to text-based detection. This fixes misclassified mods (e.g., Ritual Splinters incorrectly tagged as Legion) and properly categorizes shrine, strongbox, maven, and other mechanics that were previously all classified as "map". Added 12 new mechanics: ascendancy, cleansing (Searing Exarch), fortune, scarab, scouting, settlers, shaper, synthesis, tangle (Eater of Worlds), torment, vaal, and zana.
