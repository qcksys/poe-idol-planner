Enhanced weight filter for trade searches with new features:
- Added option for separate prefix/suffix weight sliders
- Added toggle to switch between GTE (>=) and LTE (<=) comparison modes
- Weight filter now applies to both idol trade searches and single mod searches in Browse Mods
- The "not" query group excludes all mods that match the weight criteria for that idol type
- Removed multi-select functionality from inventory panel for simpler UX
- Slider now snaps to actual mod weights instead of fixed increments
